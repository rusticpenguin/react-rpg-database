# react-rpg-database
A MongoDB database for my app, [react-rpg](https://github.com/rusticpenguin/react-rpg). This will host all user data, items, and enemies that can be encountered. This project was inspired from games such as [EarthBound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EarthBound) and [Undertale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undertale).
___
## Planned Features:
 - Using a form of authentication so admins can CRUD items, moves, and enemies
 - Store enemy, items, moves, and player data in a way that can be easily access by my app
 - Allow players to login to their characters

## Techs:
 - [react](https://github.com/facebook/react)
 - [react-canvas](https://github.com/Flipboard/react-canvas) or [react-konva](https://github.com/konvajs/react-konva)... still have to do my research
